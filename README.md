# IngressIntelMap
A very simple Android app that uses an Intent to launch the official Ingress Intel Map web app.

Built with Android Studio 2.2 Preview 2.

When you install the APK on an Android device, it will open to a view with an Ingress logo. 
Tapping on the logo sends a web intent to launch the Ingress Intel Map at https://www.ingress.com/intel

That's it!
Nothing spectacular, I just wanted a fast way to open the official Ingress Intel Map on my phone and didn't much care for
any of the apps in the Google Play Store.
